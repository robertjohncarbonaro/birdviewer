The above is the solution for the following brief:

The app should have a dummy login screen with username, password and login button. On login, it should show some data in a tableview if you’re developing iOS application or in a list view if you’re developing Android application. Data in the list can be hardcoded list of animals, birds, or anything that you wish to show.

## Developer Notes

This example assumes that no actual login authentication process was to be implemented at this stage.

The example also features the items listed in the tableview hardcoded in the form of a basic string array, as this was the simplest solution.
